The Gaming Room was a client who was trying to expand their android game to many different devices using a new design pattern. The design pattern I recommended in this document was the client/server design pattern with client and server applications written in Java so that they can be compatable with differnt underlying computer architectures.  The process of working through a design document was helpful when developing the code because it clearly defined the design constraints and allowed me to outline exactly what would be needed. The users needs are described in the design document so there is no mistake exactly what software the client wants. This is important to consider this so that the client's needs are accurately incorporated in the development process. When providing this documentation, my application code was done particularly well. The application code explained the relationships between different classes in the game code as well as the methods of those classes. In the design document I approached the software design as a client/server design pattern with a Windows server written in Java. In the future I could use this strategy of creating a design document to analyze and design similar software applications. There are also parts I would revise in the future, such as including more options for development tools and submitting my work on time. Improving those two obsticles would allow me to get a perfect score.
